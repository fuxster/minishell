# minishell

Through the Minishell project, I got to the core of the Unix system and explored an important part of
this systemâ€™s API: process creation and synchronisation.

Besides the basic functionality of a shell (management of the environment and the command
interpreter), I had to implement this series of builtins: cd, echo, setenv, unsetenv, env and exit.
