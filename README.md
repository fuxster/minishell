# Minishell

## About

Minishell is the second project of the Unix branch at 42.
It's a minimum viable version of a real shell.
The main goal is to have a good understanding of process creation and
synchronisation using the C programmming language.

Through the Minishell project, I got to the core of the Unix system and explored 
an important part of this systemâ€™s API: process creation and synchronisation.

Besides the basic functionality of a shell (management of the environment and 
the command interpreter), I had to implement this series of builtins:
```
cd, echo, setenv, unsetenv, env and exit.
```
